  <p>
    This capstone is conducted in partnership with <strong>Keating Resources</strong>, a real estate investment and 
    development firm operating across the United States. The objective is to design and prototype an intelligent 
    platform capable of evaluating land opportunities using geospatial data, LLM-based querying, and automated data 
    ingestion from heterogeneous parcel datasets.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project is currently in progress, with active development focused on data architecture, LLM integration, 
    scoring methodology, and API design. Final deliverables will include a functioning backend prototype, 
    defensible investment scoring model, and documentation for future expansion.
