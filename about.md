      <p class="card-text">
        My work experience includes enterprise data governance at Southwest Airlines, where I improved GDPR compliance dashboards, mapped 500+ data assets, and presented an agentic AI travel planner to senior leadership; commercial banking operations at JPMorgan Chase, where I honed my skills in banking operations and process improvement; and project management and data solutions with nFLXn Consulting and teamUpHR. These roles have allowed me to lead projects, analyze data, and explore innovative solutions using technologies like AI, automation, and data visualization.

      <h2 class="card-title">Technical and Leadership Skills</h2>
      <p class="card-text">
        Beyond the corporate world, I‚Äôve applied my leadership skills as a private chess coach, where I guided elementary school students in building critical thinking and strategic decision-making. I also served as a Teaching Assistant under Dr. Linda Golden for Marketing for Social Profit at UT, leading classroom discussions and activities on the importance of social impact in business. Alongside these experiences, I have developed strong technical skills in Python, R, C#, SQL, and analytics platforms such as Power BI, which I strengthened through internships and academic projects. As a Master‚Äôs student, I‚Äôm now advancing into projects in data science programming, optimization, quantitative finance, unstructured data, and machine learning, continuing to grow at the intersection of business and technology.
