      <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Reaching Level 10 took a decade of consistent, hard work—training 20 hours a week, switching gyms,
        and pushing through soreness, pain, and setbacks. The rigorous training constantly pushed my boundaries
        of physical and mental endurance. It tested my limits and forged real discipline and resilience.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
        I ultimately injured my back and had to retire in my final year before college. Even so, I left proud
        of what I accomplished, highlighted by a <strong class="text-slate-900">4th-place finish in the region on parallel bars</strong>,
        and confident I gave it everything. That chapter may be closed, but the habits it built—pushing myself,
        staying disciplined, and embracing challenge—are very much alive.
