      <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Planning my Eagle Project—building an 8 ft picnic table for a small church—taught me invaluable skills
        in planning, organizing, delegating, and overseeing complex tasks to successful completion. This experience,
        along with earning various merit badges, adhering to the scout oath and law, and overcoming numerous challenges,
        profoundly shaped me into who I am today.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Through scouting, I developed a strong sense for leadership, teamwork, adaptability, and resilience,
        along with a commitment to civic responsibility. I'm fortunate to have volunteered for numerous organizations
        to make a positive impact on communities during my time as a Boy Scout.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
        Earning my Eagle Scout rank introduced me to lifelong friends and sparked my love for the outdoors.
        That experience shaped my adventurous spirit, and to this day I'm eager to explore new places and test my limits.
