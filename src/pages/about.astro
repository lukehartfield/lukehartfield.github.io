      I'm a recent graduate from The University of Texas at Austin with a BBA in Management Information Systems
      and a current MS in Business Analytics student (Class of 2026). I'm driven by using technology to solve

        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
          My work spans enterprise data governance at Southwest Airlines, where I improved GDPR compliance dashboards,
          mapped 500+ data assets, and presented an agentic AI travel planner to senior leadership; commercial banking
          operations at JPMorgan Chase, where I developed process improvement skills; and project management and data
          solutions with nFLXn Consulting and teamUpHR. These roles have equipped me to lead projects, analyze data,
          and build innovative solutions using AI, automation, and data visualization.

        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Beyond corporate roles, I've applied my leadership as a private chess coach, guiding elementary students in
          critical thinking and strategy. I also served as a Teaching Assistant under Dr. Linda Golden for Marketing
          for Social Profit at UT, leading classroom discussions on social impact in business.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
          I've developed strong technical skills in Python, R, C#, SQL, and platforms like Power BI through internships
          and academic projects. As a Master's student, I'm advancing into data science programming, optimization,
          quantitative finance, unstructured data, and machine learning.

          Outside of work, I'm interested in blockchain, the outdoors, game theory, coding, and options trading.
          I'm fluent in French and driven to explore the intersection of finance, technology, and data analytics.
          I also love to travel—check out my <a href="/travel/" class="text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-700 font-medium">travel page</a> to see where I've been.
