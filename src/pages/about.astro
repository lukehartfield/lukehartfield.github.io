      <Card class="p-6">
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
          At Realocity, I am building an end to end AI pipeline product that is actively used by customer facing
          teams to deliver services to more than 50 clients. My work spans product design, backend services,
          model orchestration, and workflow automation, with a focus on reliability, cost efficiency, and real
          user impact. I regularly work with stakeholders to translate business requirements into technical
          systems and then help build and ship those solutions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Previously, I worked in enterprise data governance at Southwest Airlines, where I improved access to
          data artifacts, mapped more than 500 data assets into the enterprise Data Catalog, and supported privacy
          and compliance reporting. I also worked in commercial banking operations at JPMorgan Chase, where I
          developed a strong foundation in financial processes, risk analysis, and operational execution.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-4">Technical and Leadership Skills</h2>
      <Card class="p-6">
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I have a strong technical toolkit across Python, full stack development, machine learning models,
          data engineering, and analytics platforms. Through both industry work and graduate coursework, I have
          built production grade ML systems, optimization models, and data pipelines that support real decision
          making. My academic background and work experience also give me a solid grounding in finance, including
          quantitative analysis, markets, and trading.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
          I am especially effective in hybrid roles where I can work directly with stakeholders, understand the
          business process, and help design and implement the underlying system. In addition to technical work,
          I have held leadership roles as a Teaching Assistant at UT and as a private chess coach, both of which
          strengthened my ability to communicate complex ideas and lead teams through structured problem solving.

      <Card class="p-6">
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
          I am deeply interested in agentic AI systems and how intelligent workflows can augment real business
          operations. I actively follow markets and investing, checking the market daily and exploring how data
          and models can inform better decisions. Outside of tech, I am passionate about bass fishing, chess, bouldering, and the outdoors. I am always open to connecting with others building at the
          intersection of AI, data, finance, and product.
