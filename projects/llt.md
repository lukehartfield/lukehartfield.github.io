  <h1 class="mb-3">Ladies Let’s Talk: EPP Volunteer Matching &amp; Automation System</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Client-facing capstone project where I led project management, solution architecture, and development
    to automate the matching process for a program serving more than <strong>1,600 learners</strong>
    and <strong>900+ volunteers</strong>.

  <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Client-Facing Software Delivery – MIS 374 Capstone<br/>
  <strong>Roles:</strong> Project Manager · Solutions Architect · Lead Developer<br/>
  <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Airtable · JavaScript · Automation Scripts · Trello · Slack · Google Drive</p>

  <h2>Project Goal</h2>
  <p>
    The English Practice Partners (EPP) program pairs immigrant and refugee women with volunteer English-speaking partners.
    Before this project, the entire process—collecting applications, reviewing availability, pairing partners—was done
    manually in Google Sheets across hundreds of participants per cohort.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our goal was to build a scalable, automated system capable of reliably matching large cohorts (150–250 participants each cycle)
    while reducing coordinator workload and eliminating manual matching errors.
  </p>

  <h2>End-to-End Solution Overview</h2>
  <p>
    As Project Manager, Solutions Architect, and Lead Developer, I led the engagement from kickoff through launch.
    The delivered platform now automates every major workflow: intake, validation, matching, communication, cohort
    management, and archival.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the most recent cohort, the system successfully matched <strong>198+ learner–volunteer pairs</strong> with a
    <strong>98.7% completion rate</strong>. The platform is now operated independently by LLT staff and supports future
    cohorts of similar or larger scale.

  <h2>My Role: Project Manager &amp; Solutions Architect</h2>

  <h3>Project Management</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ran weekly client meetings and maintained communication with a stakeholder group serving 1,600+ learners</li>
    <li>Planned and managed sprints for a multi-person development team using Trello and Slack</li>
    <li>Coordinated intake and testing for cohorts ranging from 150 to 250 participants</li>
    <li>Facilitated user acceptance testing with the LLT leadership team for all core workflows</li>
    <li>Owned delivery timelines and coordinated a smooth rollout to program managers and volunteers</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Solutions Architecture</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed the full ERD supporting <strong>5 major tables</strong> and <strong>200+ linked fields</strong></li>
    <li>Architected a multi-step workflow handling:
      <ul>
        <li>Intake for thousands of form submissions</li>
        <li>Matching across <strong>150–250 participants</strong> per cohort</li>
        <li>Email automation for <strong>400+ communication events</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Defined three matching algorithms with quantitative scoring and deterministic tie-breaking</li>
    <li>Built modular automation layers capable of supporting growth to <strong>500+ matches</strong> per cycle</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Core Features Delivered</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Structured Intake Forms</strong> used by 1,600+ learners and 900+ volunteers over the program’s lifetime</li>
    <li><strong>Three Matching Algorithms</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>Preferred Partner Matching (100% accuracy when valid names provided)</li>
        <li>Randomized Matching for large unmatched pools</li>
        <li>Location and Availability-Based Matching for optimal pairings</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Automated Email Workflows</strong> generating <strong>400+ emails</strong> per cohort with dynamic templates</li>
    <li><strong>Match Pool and Status Tracking</strong> for <strong>200+ active participants</strong> per cycle</li>
    <li><strong>Cohort Management Tools</strong> controlling <strong>150–250 entering participants</strong> each cycle</li>
    <li><strong>Archival Scripts</strong> preserving <strong>hundreds of match records</strong> per cohort into master tables</li>
    <li><strong>Dashboard Interfaces</strong> providing visibility into match progress, unmatched users, and key metrics</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Testing &amp; Validation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tested more than <strong>90% of user stories</strong>, including stress testing with large input volumes</li>
    <li>Achieved a <strong>98.7% match completion rate</strong> in the latest cohort</li>
    <li>Validated matching logic using real participant data across <strong>198+ successful matches</strong></li>
    <li>Ran structured UAT sessions with LLT leadership and operational staff</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sustainability &amp; Handoff</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Developed role-based training for program managers, volunteers, and future developers</li>
    <li>Delivered detailed manuals, configuration guidelines, and recorded walkthroughs</li>
    <li>Designed the workflow to minimize maintenance cost and ensure non-technical ownership</li>
    <li>Provided scalable paths for expansion across LLT’s other programs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduced matching time from hours of manual work to <strong>under 60 seconds</strong></li>
    <li>Eliminated hundreds of manual data-entry errors through validated and standardized intake</li>
    <li>Enabled LLT to confidently run large-scale cohorts without external developer support</li>
    <li>Created a scalable, low-cost model that can support <strong>500+ matches</strong> per cycle</li>
    <li>Delivered a transformation used by a program serving <strong>1,600+ women and 900+ volunteers</strong></li>
  </ul>
