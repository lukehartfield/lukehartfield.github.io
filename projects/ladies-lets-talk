    Ladies Let&apos;s Talk is a non-profit focused on connecting learners with volunteer partners for English practice and mentorship. 
    This project rebuilt the matching and tracking process from manual spreadsheets into an automated data pipeline and web-based workflow.

      <h2 class="h5">Project Overview</h2>
      <p class="card-text">
        The organization previously relied on ad-hoc spreadsheets and manual matching, which did not scale as cohorts grew.
        I designed a structured data model and matching system that ingests learner and volunteer submissions, applies
        rule-based and score-based matching logic, and outputs clean match records that can be monitored over time.

      <p class="card-text mb-2">
        The system cut the time required to build each cohort&apos;s matches from days to hours, and reduced
        errors caused by manual copy-paste operations. Program coordinators now have a repeatable process to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Import new learner and volunteer data.</li>
        <li>Run the matching algorithm with clear criteria.</li>
        <li>Export final match lists and send introduction emails.</li>
        <li>Track historical cohorts and re-engage volunteers over time.</li>
      </ul>
