      <p class="card-text">
        Planning my Eagle Project to build an 8 ft picnic table for a small church taught me invaluable skills in planning, organizing, delegating, and overseeing complex tasks to successful completion. This experience, along with earning various merit badges, adhering to the scout oath and law, and overcoming numerous challenges, has profoundly shaped me into the person I am today.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        Through scouting, I have developed a strong sense for leadership, teamwork, adaptability, and resilience. I also have a commitment to civic responsibility instilled in me. I am fortunate to have volunteered for numerous organizations to make a positive impact on communities during my time as a Boy Scout.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        I have met some lifelong friends and have grown fond of the outdoors as a result of becoming an Eagle Scout. Even now, I am very adventurous and excited to always go explore the world and test my limits.
