      <p class="card-text">
        Reaching Level 10 took a decade of consistent, hard work - training 20 hours a week, switching gyms, and pushing through soreness, pain, and setbacks. The rigorous training constantly pushed my boundaries of physical and mental endurance. It tested my limits and forged real discipline and resilience.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
          I ultimately injured my back and had to retire in my final year before college. Even so, I left proud of what I accomplished, highlighted by a 4th-place finish in the region on parallel bars, and confident I gave it everything. That chapter may be closed, but the habits it built of pushing myself, staying disciplined, and embracing challenge are very much alive.
